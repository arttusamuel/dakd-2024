    "The previous exercise was about <i>data understanding</i> and <i>data preparation</i>, which formed the basis for the modeling phase of the data mining process. Many modeling techniques make assumptions about the data, so the exploration and preparation phases can't be ignored. Now, as we have checked the validity of data and familiarized ourselves with it, we can move on to the next stage of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), which is <font color = green>modeling</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions to be answered at this stage could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What kind of model architecture best fits our data?\n",
    "- How well does the model perform technically?\n",
    "- Could we improve its performance?\n",
    "- How do we evaluate the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Machine learning</i> is a subfield of artificial intelligence that provides automatic, objective and data-driven techniques for modeling the data. Its two main branches are <i>supervised learning</i> and <i>unsupervised learning</i>, and in this exercise, we are going to use the former, <font color = green>supervised learning</font>, for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, data remains the same as in the previous exercise, but I've already cleaned it up for you. Some data pre-processing steps are still required to ensure that it's in an appropriate format so that models can learn from it. Even though we are not conducting any major data exploration nor data preparation this time, <i>you should never forget it in your future data analyses</i>.\n",

    "#### General Guidance for Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Complete all tasks:</b> Make sure to answer all questions, even if you cannot get your script to fully work.\n",
    "- <b>Code clarity:</b> Write clear and readable code. Include comments to explain what your code does.\n",
    "- <b>Effective visualizations:</b> Ensure all plots have labeled axes, legends, and captions. Your visualizations should clearly represent the underlying data.\n",
    "- <b>Notebook organization:</b> You can add more code or markdown cells to improve the structure of your notebook as long as it maintains a logical flow.\n",
    "- <b>Submission:</b> Submit both the .ipynb and .html or .pdf versions of your notebook. Before finalizing your notebook, use the \"Restart & Run All\" feature to ensure it runs correctly.\n",
    "- <b>Grading criteria:</b>\n",
    "    - The grading scale is *Fail*/*Pass*/*Pass with honors* (+1).\n",
    "    - To pass, you must complete the required parts 1-4.\n",
    "    - To achieve Pass with honors, complete the bonus exercises.\n",
    "- <b>Technical issues:</b>\n",
    "    - If you encounter problems, start with an online search to find solutions but do not simply copy and paste code. Understand any code you use and integrate it appropriately.\n",
    "    - Cite all external sources used, whether for code or explanations.\n",
    "    - If problems persist, ask for help in the course discussion forum, at exercise sessions, or via email at tuhlei@utu.fi, aibekt@utu.fi.\n",
    "- <b>Use of AI and large language models:</b>\n",
    "    - We do not encourage the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. If you use them, critically evaluate their outputs.\n",
    "    - Describe how you used the AI tools in your work, including your input and how the output was beneficial.\n",
    "- <b>Time management:</b> Do not leave your work until the last moment. No feedback will be available during weekends.\n",
    "- <b>Additional notes:</b>\n",
    "    - You can find the specific deadlines and session times for each assignment on the Moodle course page.\n",
    "    - Ensure all your answers are conciseâ€”typically a few sentences per question.\n",
    "    - Your .ipynb notebook is expected to be run to completion, which means that it should execute without errors when all cells are run in sequence.\n",

Note here, that model selection and model evaluation (or assessment) are two different things: We use model selection to estimate the performance of various models to identify the model which is most likely to provide the \"best\" predictive performance for the task.

Remember that the model here is essentially just a linear regression model with an added regularization term to deal with e.g overfitting and multicollinearity.

In the equation above, each feature contibutes a certain amount to the predicted age, based on the weight $w_i$ learned for that feature. For example, if the total length of an opossum has a large positive weight, it suggests that opossums with greater length are predicted to be older. On the other hand, if the skull width of an opossum has a negative weight, it indicates that opossums with wider skulls are predicted to be younger. In this case, as skull width increases, the predicted age decreases.\n",

    "Different classes have different class attributes that you can access after e.g. fitting a model, and the `Ridge` class is no exception: For example, the `coef_` variable contains the learned weights $w_1, ..., w_{10}$ that represent the relationship between the features and the target (a.k.a age) variable. The `intercept_` variable holds the bias term (or the intercept, however we wanna call it). \n",
