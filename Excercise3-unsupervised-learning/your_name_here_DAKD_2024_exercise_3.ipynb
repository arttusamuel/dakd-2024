    "#### General Guidance for Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete all tasks**: Make sure to answer all questions, even if you cannot get your script to fully work.\n",
    "- **Code clarity**: Write clear and readable code. Include comments to explain what your code does.\n",
    "- **Effective visualizations**: Ensure all plots have labeled axes, legends, and captions. Your visualizations should clearly represent the underlying data.\n",
    "- **Notebook organization**: You can add more code or markdown cells to improve the structure of your notebook as long as it maintains a logical flow.\n",
    "- **Submission**: Submit both the `.ipynb` and `.html` or `.pdf` versions of your notebook. Before finalizing your notebook, use the \"Restart & Run All\" feature to ensure it runs correctly.\n",
    "- **Grading criteria**:\n",
    "    - The grading scale is *Fail/Pass/Pass with honors* (+1).\n",
    "    - To pass, you must complete the required parts 0-3.\n",
    "    - To achieve *Pass with honors*, complete the bonus exercises.\n",
    "- **Technical issues**:\n",
    "    - If you encounter problems, start with an online search to find solutions but do not simply copy and paste code. Understand any code you use and integrate it appropriately.\n",
    "    - Cite all external sources used, whether for code or explanations.\n",
    "    - If problems persist, ask for help in the course discussion forum, at exercise sessions, or via email at konsta.k.nyman@utu.fi or antti.s.vasankari@utu.fi.\n",
    "- **Use of AI and large language models**:\n",
    "    - We do not encourage the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. If you use them, critically evaluate their outputs.\n",
    "    - Describe how you used the AI tools in your work, including your input and how the output was beneficial.\n",
    "- **Time management**: Do not leave your work until the last moment. No feedback will be available during weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes**:\n",
    "- You can find the specific deadlines and session times for each assignment on the Moodle course page.\n",
    "- Ensure all your answers are conciseâ€”typically a few sentences per question.\n",
    "- Your .ipynb notebook is expected to be run to completion, which means that it should execute without errors when all cells are run in sequence.\n",

Rand index is a measure of similarity between two partitions of a set of elements. Adjusted Rand index is corrected for chance using the maximum and expected values of Rand index. Optionally, you can learn more about the Rand index e.g. on [the Wikipedia page for Rand index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index). Here you can simply use the `sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score` method imported at the beginning of this notebook without further understanding of it. \n",
